# A two-dimensional turing machine written  in Rust

This is a little pet-project. It is inspired by the "turing drawings" website [^1] that changes the original one-dimensional tape-memory to a two-dimensional memory. Instead of only going left-right the "tape-head" can now also move up and down. In my case the tape is finite though and repeates itself.
